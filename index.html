        <h1>Nabanita Das</h1>
        <h2>Graphic designer, Web designer and Visual artist.</h2>

        <p>
          I am Nabanita Das. Currently I am a student learning Graphic design
          and Web design in Wake Tech College.
        </p>
        <p>
          As an avid art enthusiast, both physical and digital, Iâ€™ve created
          numerous art projects and have taken various classes including
          advanced photoshop studies, graphic and web design, as well as
          illustration courses. Atop delving headfirst into projects such as
          logo designing, website development, and editing photographs, I also
          teach a plethora of hands-on art forms, including acrylic, oil, and
          charcoal, to children and adults. Whatever the challenge or task, as
          an enthusiastic, diligent, conscientious, and creative learner and
          educator I am willing to find a way!
